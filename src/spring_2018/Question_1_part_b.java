/*
In this code, there will be no compile/run-time error. After that, if we run the code
there will be no specific output in the console, because there is no use of "System.out.prinln()" method.
In Test3 class's method "addTwoNumbers" just return the sum of provided two numbers, and inside Test1 class's
"main" method creates an "obj" Object which is Test3 type, through the "obj" object, use "addTwoNumbers" method.
In this case we use "addTwoNumbers" method, and we know that this method return sum of two numbers,
but we don't store anywhere or print directly. That's why this code run properly without showing any output.
