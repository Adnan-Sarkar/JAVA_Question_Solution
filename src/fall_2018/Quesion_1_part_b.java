/*
i. int c [ ], x
This is basically declaring aa array in different way, we can write [] after the array-name, but if we declare
an array with this style and try to define another variable separated with comma, then compiler will take
fist one as an array and second one is declared type variable. in this case c is One-Dimension-Array and
x is an integer variable;

ii. int [ ] c, x
This is declaring One-Dimension-Array for c and x array-name;
